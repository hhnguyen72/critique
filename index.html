          <h3> Amanda Shearon </h3>
          <p>
            Shearon's portfolio display a great example of a flat and minimalism done correctly. First, the images she provided (just enough)
             demonstrate her UI skill of using the clean and visual images as projects to select. Her UX experience display
             is presented also via the images due to when hovering over the image, it goes slightly darker and provided the project name which
             will guarantee to attract someone's eyes with a transition from white body. Second, the home page itself is quite short when comparing
             to others' portfolio; however, she took the initiative of a short context and make it into an unique visual portfolio.
             Lastly, her usage of white spaces and fonts (Arial and cursive)give the eyes something easy to read.
             This is a professional portfolio weathy to a potential employee.
             <br>
             <br>
              I tried to follow how she presented her work with the images and white spaces, so I primary used a white color background for the images and texts.
              The hover effect with changing the image brightness is something I found visual appleasing due to be able to catch my attention.
              The difference between Shearon and mine are I used an one page navigation while she did not, I used texts in the white space something to
              focus one while she just used the images to catch people's attention, and I used a black navbar & footer while she completely used white for the entire context.

            <h3>Alex Eiman & Ivo Mynttitien</h3>
            <p>
              Eiman's portfolio is more as resume due to its being short enough just to get attraction to the potential employer.
              It follow a short description about himself, his project which is next to the images to rather stand out, and boring footer.
              The page have the professionalism of a resume that will stand-out out of the rest. but to display his skill as UX/UI designer,
              it is rather simple to keep the eyes moving. The primary color for the body is white to serve the purpose when the eyes approach
              the image, they will look next to it seeing well-done description and button to see the project. The design approach is a Flat/Minimalism due
              to it being very simple which include his font as well.
              <br>
              <br>
              Mynttitien's portfolio is more closer to a resume than Eiman; however, he used space to complement any texts and images (he did not rather used that much)
              in the very short page. Compared to Shearon's portfolio, she used space for images and while Mynttitien used space for texts. Mynttitien's portfolio
              used white, black, and grey color as section when the context change. Personally, if described, it is a "Flat/Minimalism calligraphy" more than a portfolio
              due to his manipulation of space to complement any texts he used.
              <br>
              <br>
                I selected Eiman's portfolio to understand the boundary of too much creativity to simplicity. However, I was inspired by
                the image and text description in white space approach. He primary did 2 columns approach; rather,I wanted to text the limits
                of it to gain more experience. His portfolio could also work for a business person if wanted to be hired while I tried to
                emphasize more on creativity as front-end designer. I wanted my navbar to be fixed to navigate to "jump" to others sections
                while his navbar disappear after leaving the home section until coming back to the footer.
                I selected Mynttitien's portfolio for his "Flat/Minimalism calligraphy" approach. Another is his 3 columns, which I used to compare the two
                resume-looking portfolios (Alex Eiman & Ivo Mynttitie). I personally do not think in my website, I have truely demonstrate Mynttitien's ability of
                fonts and space.

              <h3>Blend Design Agency </h3>
              <p>
              Blend's portfolio is different from the rest of the portfolios here due to being a design agency rather than an individual.
              The UX/UI elements have completely being in used with the responive, full-width images and text alongisde with simple cinemagraph when hovering
              over the section. It is not a business professional, but it show its' mastery in the creative side instead. When scrolling down, each images alongisde
              the text description it provided is enough to create a good portfolio: 7 images for 7 portfolios. The flat design alongside sans serif text is good for
              creativity, but for a business person, it is too much. The color make it seems surreal.
              <br>
              <br>
              When I approached this portfolio, it immediately catch my eye due to the surreal color. It used only one different color to change context, but I used white entirely.
              I do not have any cinemagraphs due to my lack of experience of making one. My hower effect is pale in comparison to Blend's hover and cinemagraph combination. This portfolio
              is top-tier design which I need to work to reach.

            <h3> Tobias Ahlin </h3>
            <p>
              Tobias's portfolio is great example of flat/minimalism design with a mastery of white space to
              complement the animated, responsive context of projects using both texts and images to described it.
              Each sections have different colors and images which usually is too much for UX design, but here,
              it is perfect due to the white space have focus in on the pannel/section. He used san text which
              does not express contemporary design, but with all of the pannels done well, the san font provide
              elegant to a contemporary design. It is prefect for both business and design employee. Overall,
              Tobias's portfolio demonstrate his mastery of space, fonts, ux, ui, creativity, and professionalism.
              <br>
              <br>
            Compared to my website to his portfolio, I just barely started while Tobias is epitome of design. My columns need more work due to
            Tobias making every columns visually equal despite using different row size. His white space make his readible while I still have
            a large area of white space left which will be a distrance to the eyes. Even I was using a san serif font, his san font made his design elegant and minimalism.
            He was able to make sure his text description is condense and precisely ableit I am critiquing. I will strive to reach that level.
